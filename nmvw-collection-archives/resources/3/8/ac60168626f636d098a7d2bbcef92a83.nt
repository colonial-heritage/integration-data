<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/a5bcefb456b2940f50fa3238d83be8bf> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Heavy handheld pair of iron clappers, each clapper consisting of two cymbal- like discs, joined together by a shank. The clappers are bound to each other by a strip of leather. A player holds two sets of clappers, controling them with dance-like movements of the hands. Shkashek are only played by Africans during religious festivities, in Marrakesh, however, also used in a secular context." .
