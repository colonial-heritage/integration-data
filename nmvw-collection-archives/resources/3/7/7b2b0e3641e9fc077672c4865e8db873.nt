<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/6923b074d78ccfdf8292cfbf3d0dfefb> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This small ornament was hung on the dancing aprons, mostly the bark-cloth aprons to make a rattling noise. \r\nThe main piece is an oval nut, which is damaged as it is cracked in half. Fibre cords are attached to the shell of the nut. They have shell discs, red dried seeds and Job's tears woven into them. Another bigger shell is tied to the end of the string. One of the strings is torn off halfway.\r\nWhen these strings are moved and they bang against the wood or against each other, it would cause the rattling noise. \r\nMost of the time, several rattles are attached to the apron worn by men during dance ceremonies." .
