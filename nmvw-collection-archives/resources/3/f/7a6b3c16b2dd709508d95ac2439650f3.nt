<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/8b3ab7b6931f0e56cbca90f74e01fc3b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a poster/advertisement for the Fine Knitting Mills in India, although we are not sure what region, city, or village it is from. The advertisement has a distinctly nationalist aesthetic, with a depiction of Bharat Mata (Mother India), or the goddess as the nation. Bharat Mata was first visualised by artist Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951). It was conceived as part of the swadeshi ('of one's own country') movement in 1905, an integral part of Indian independence. His early depiction did not include the map of India, but simply an image of a female form, presumed to be 'mother'. It was in 1919 in Faizabad that the first instance of Bharat Mata accompanied by a territorial map of India most likely was visualised. The figure of Bharat Mata was an essential trope of Indian independence movements, and continues to have major significance within the aesthetics of current Hindu Nationalism. \r\nAt the same time, Indian industry, such as weaving, and milling, were important parts of self-rule strategies and ideologies. Spinning one's own cloth and buying from local businesses was a key symbol of independence and self-reliance. That this is an advertisement for a knitting mill is also significant: the relationship between Indian textile industries in the past and pride in India as a nation is a historically significant link." .
