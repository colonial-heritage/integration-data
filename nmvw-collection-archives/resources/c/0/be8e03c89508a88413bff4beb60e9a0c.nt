<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/60e715e053c4dc2a26b90dcbe572241f> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Archaeological evidence indicates that during prehistoric and Historic period in the Southeast basketry included mats and baskets used for storing, transporting, gathering and processing food and interring the dead. Basket making is a women's craft with specific rules designating which women are allowed to make a special kind of basket. For example, grandmothers or older women past menopause can make certain baskets to protect the power of the medicine. The traditional raw material for basketry in Louisiana is cane (Arundinaria tecta) but is has almost disappeared because of changing agricultural practices. Since 1920's the needles of the Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustrus) have proved to be a sufficient replacement of cane. At the same time, the raffia palm fiber (Raphia farinifera) substituted the elm inner-bark (Ulmus) which was used to stitch the coils together. Today practically all Koasati basketry is made of coiled pine needles with raffia.\t\tThis crocodile is made of coiled pine needles, sewn together with raffia. Pine cone scales are sewn on the basket. All kinds of animal effigy baskets are very popular among collectors. Made for tourist industry. \tCrocodiles or specifically, alligators are native to the Southeast of the United States. The alligator appears in several myths of the tribes living in the culture area. In these tales, the alligator plays different parts. In some stories the alligator gets fooled by the trickster animal the rabbit and in other stories the alligator fulfils wishes after somebody carries him to the water. Alligator leather was very much in demand in Europe since the 1870's and with the upcoming tourist industry in the late 19th century and the early 20th century alligator eggs and baby alligators became popular as souvenirs. One important tourist attraction in the Southeast and mainly in Florida is alligator wrestling. It started in 1919 when young Seminole men got inspired by the first alligator wrestler Henry Coppinger Jr. Tribal elders were first reluctant to allow this kind of recreation and permission had to be asked from an Old Snake Clan woman (related to the extinct Alligator Clan) because it was not usual to taunt an animal. Even today this dangerous activity is carried out and it is a legal profession that is handed down from generation to generation." .
