They are hewn from the wood of the mountain mahogany tree, the hardest wood the Zunis know and which at the same time is used to make their clubs. The hardness of this wood symbolizes the prayer for courage and strength against the enemy. The red color, with which the sticks are painted, is called a'hokon (depiction of war) and denotes blood. With one exception the feathers come from various birds of prey and are named la'tsumaywuh or 'powerful feathers.' They have a dual signification: destruction and spiritual fortitude. One prays to be in a condition to pursue the enemy just as relentlessly as the birds of prey their victims. The only feather that does not come from a bird of prey is the one from the wing of a wild duck, which is one of the Zuni water gods and thus the symbol of strength and swiftness on the warpath. The downy feathers are called ha'showahn (ear) and probably signify that the 'misty spirits of the gods' may hear the prayer.\" Later he added a note: \"Mr. Cushing is not completely sure about this last statement.\" Ten Kate also published his notes on prayer sticks in the Revue d'Ethnographie (1884).\r\n(Hovens 2008-09)\r\n\r\nTwee gebedstokken tezamen in omhulsel van ma√Øsblad." .
