<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/46bbf3f0c501b037b2065a1c8706fc70> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This spear has two parts. It has a very long wooden handle and a wooden shaft, into which three ray-spines of different length are stuck. The lower part of the joint between handle and spines is coated with a layer of Parinarium. The wooden piece is left uncoated and shows a crocodile's mouth which has a double-headed being between its jaws. The ray-spines are secured with a long fibre cord which is wound around them very tightly. Then this is coated with Parinarium. The coat has several beads inserted and is painted with black and white. \r\nThe spear could be used as a fishing spear or as a weapon in war and open battle. It was thrown from a long distance. \r\nWarfare was one of the two areas in which the continuing vitality and power of a leading family or leading man were demonstrated. It was therefore crucial for maintaining the social hierarchy and can be seen as having been a normal aspect of life on the Admiralty Islands. The intensity and frequency of raids and fights probably increased after the arrival of Westerners, because they sold iron and weapons to the islanders which were firstly more effective and secondly produced an imbalance of power between the different clans. The warfare was prevented from the 1930s by the colonial governments. According to reports, the Admiralty Islanders did not hesitate at first to attack white people which were coming to the island. This was during the 18th century, when the English visited and chartered the islands and the existence of obsidian-tipped spears and daggers were reported then. This ceased as the islands began to be governed by white colonists. \r\nAmbushes or raids at dawn were frequent. The actual reasons or causes for attacks are not known, except that a leader would prove his strength and ability. The warriors were mostly young, unmarried adult men which were lead by a clan or group leader. They carried spears, javelins and daggers. All people in the attacked villages were killed, the eyes were gouged out with the sharp obsidian blades and sometimes the heads were cut off to be taken home as a trophy. Houses were burnt down. Fights were also decided on boats on the water." .
