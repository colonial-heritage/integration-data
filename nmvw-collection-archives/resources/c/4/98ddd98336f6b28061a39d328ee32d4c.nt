Who would find the tip of the lingga (phallus, source of fertility) of Shiva? Vishnu took the form of a wild boar and went deep down into the earth, where he met the waters of Ibu Pertiwi, Goddess of the Earth. Brahma took the form of a bird and went high up in the sky where he met the fire of the God of the Sun, Surya. Neither managed to find the ends, since the lingga of Shiva is endless. So they acknowledged that Shiva is most powerful. But they had discovered that the origin of all life is the meeting of earth and sky, of water and fire, of male and female.”" .
