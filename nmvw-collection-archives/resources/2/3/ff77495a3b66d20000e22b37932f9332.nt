<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/849ab7c8693f6e58b36bc25ea6a7cdd6> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a rare painted cloth It belongs to the category of bebali, textiles that have ritual functions. They are mostly made with a continuous warp on a backstrap loom, and made of handspun cotton. They can be removed from the loom with the warp intact, which is essential in some rituals which have to do with the cycle of life. The cloth is decorated with a beautiful painting (with some added details in gold leaf) of Semara and Ratih, the deities of eternal love and desire embracing one another, standing on a lotus flower.\r\n\r\nSuch a cloth can be used at a toothfiling (initiation) ceremony. During the seclusion prior to toothfiling the candidates stroke forehead and cheek with a cloth displaying the design of the gods of love, and thus become involved in a symbolic manner with love.\r\n\r\nThis type of cloth is called usap rai. Usap means ‘to clean off’, ‘to clear from’ (for instance: sins) and rai is face. The cloth itself can only be made by women who do not menstruate anymore, using Balinese handspun cotton and after weaving the drawing or painting is put on by men. It is only used when the ritual is carried out at the highest level of ritual elaboration (and that does not happen very often), using a large offering called banten tegteg. The usap rai is first hung down from this offering, with the drawing in front. After the actual filing of the six upper teeth the so-called mapedamel ritual is carried out. This means that the young people whose teeth have just been filed have to taste 33 different kinds of food with different tastes, meaning they experience life to the fullest. When they do this, they wear the usap rai over their shoulder (women over their right and men over their left shoulder), the drawing in front. But before they actually wear the usap rai, they first pray with the cloth between their hands, and then they wave it over incense and touch their forehead with the drawing. They are now ready for love and marriage.\r\n \r\nThere is an other use for the usap rai, the initiation ceremony (madiksa) of a high priest. Here the symbolism is opposite, because after their initiation high priests refrain from sexuality. After the initiation the cloth is stored away, and after his death it is burnt with the body during the cremation ritual. So the usap rai I want to acquire for the museum cannot have been used for this kind of ritual purpose.\r\nUsap rai are still being made, since they are still used for initiation rituals (for young adults and for priests), but one has to order them well in advance, sometimes at least a year prior to a madiksa ceremony." .
