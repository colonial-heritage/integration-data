Though there are smaller examples in the BM, this complex painted cloth is the finest piece extant. The pa'oa, cloth, has been stained orange with turmeric, yellow with extract from the roots of noni (Morinda citrifolia) and black with candlenut (tuitui) which was also used as ink in tattooing and formany other purposes. Barkcloth was notably used in rites marking the birth of children, but also in other contexts.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the work has been viewed and studied by indigenous researchers from Aitutaki, including Ngaa Kitai Pureariki, who took various elements of the designs to represent holding hands, principles of unity, ranges of hills in ancestral landsm the juxtapositin between ao (the world of the living and light) and po (night, darkness and the afterlife) He also sensed tension in the interplay between designs and wondered whether the work reflected social conflicts among clans at the time of its creation. The two central panels to the right featuring twelve and seven canoes respectively are likely to have evoked narratives of particular voyages or naval expeditions.\r\n\r\n(Brunt Peter, Thomas Nicholas, Oceania, 2018, Royal Academy of Arts p. 296)" .
