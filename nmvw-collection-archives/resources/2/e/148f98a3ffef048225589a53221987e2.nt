<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/4e8878178ba1e8697d364617eb423aa5> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This bowl is very large and hewn from one piece of palm wood. The diameter is round and the bowl has four cylindrical feet. The surface is polished with a checkering file and a pumice and coloured dark brown after. The bowl has separately carved handles, which are glued to the bowl where it has notches. Only on is left in the collection. The handles served as decoration and not as handles, as the bowl was too heavy to lift on the handles anyway. \r\nThe outer side has carved decorations, a carved band around the upper rim which shows geometrical patterns. Some symbols that look like a sun are painted on the outside. The carving of the bowls was the job of men. The production of such large festive bowls had probably ceased by the 1930s.\r\nThe handles have the form of an ornament, which can also be found on the prow and stern of a canoe. The bottom part has carved openwork. The connection to canoes is important, as both were associated with clans and clan symbols. The patterns could have been clan insignia.  \r\nThe bowl was due to its size not used as a personal dish, but rather as a ceremonial vessel. It was for example used to store all the coconut oil, which was given to a bride on her wedding day. \r\nIt was also used to serve and distribute large portions of accumulated food on ceremonial occasions, which was important to support the redistributional practice in a village." .
