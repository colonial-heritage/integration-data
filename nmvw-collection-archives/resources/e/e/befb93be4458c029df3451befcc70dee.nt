<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/ffb69d558abf7171e67c8ac6065ff340> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This small ornament was hung on the dancing aprons, mostly the bark-cloth aprons to make a rattling noise. \r\nThe main piece is made from a light wood. It has a cylindrical upper part and opens up into a bell-shaped body which is hollowed out. There are little holes all round the rim of the opening and originally, fibre cords were tied to them. They have shell discs, red dried seeds and Job's tears woven into them. When these strings are moved and they bang against the wood or against each other, it would cause the rattling noise. \r\nMost of the time, several rattles are attached to the apron worn by men during dance ceremonies.    \r\n\r\nOn this object, the strings are missing. It is not sure whether they are still in the collection. On the museum card, it only says that this object is damaged, although it doesn't say where or what is damaged." .
