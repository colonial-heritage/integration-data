Originally they had been standing separately and more towards the downstream end of the yeu. We were told that a police patrol which had visited the village a couple of weeks before us had removed the figures to where we found them because they wanted the downstream end of the yeu for a bivouc. Both figures showed the interesting treatment of the hair as noticed before on the first figure in the upstream end of the yeu. They also have j√ºrfepin marks incised on arms and legs, i.e., the typical Asmat scarification tattoo marks. The smaller figure was carved by Fupi and represented Domepon, Fupi's grandfather, that is, his father's father. The larger figure was carved by Safanminim and represented Kandai, Safanminim's father's father." .
