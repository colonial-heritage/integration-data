In his MA thesis 'Inheemse Regsgemeenskappe', J.F. Holleman gives his full name as uKhambi Mzimelo and also states that he was the head induna of all the impi in Zululand. He appears have been Holleman's primary informant on Zulu regimental organization and political organization and Holleman thanks him in the preface to the thesis." .
