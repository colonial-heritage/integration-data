<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/c90324fd09369f9465f2ed9069ba0192> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This spear is made completely from wood. A long, thin and pointy wooden spear head is tied to a wooden shaft, probably made from a hollowed reed like bamboo. The joint is wound with fibre cords and then coated with Parinarium. The long tip of the spear head has five rings of barbs which look towards the shaft and are painted with white, black and red. The rest of the spear head is adorned with elaborate carvings which are coloured white with lime, black and white. \r\n\r\nDue to its delicate structure and the elaborate decoration, as well as the not so pointy tip, it could be assumed that this spear was not used as a weapon in battle but rather as a ceremonial object held in hand by men during dances. As there is no further information, this remains an assumption." .
