<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/e3afed495b1ac0821b85a2cb98ca02bd> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The comb is made of coconut leaf ribs which are tied together with plant fibre. At the upper end the skewers are glued together with a mass of Parinarium nut. The Parinarium is coloured with red from the mbuhul plant. The upper part with the Parinarium mass is decorated with incisions which are coloured with white lime, black coal and red mbuhul. The skewers are held apart by one horizontal bar, which would normally have been removed after the handle had been coated and the skewers would remain in their position.\r\nThis comb is used as a decoration in the hair and worn at special occasions. \r\nWorn mostly by men as decoration in the hair. Women sometimes wore such combs when in their wedding attire." .
