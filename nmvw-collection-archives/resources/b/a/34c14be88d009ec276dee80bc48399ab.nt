(at rim) 23.5 cm., w. 22 cm., h. 10.8 cm; ca. 1880.\r\n\tThis Papago square-bottomed and round-rimmed basket (cf. 362-31) was collected at San Xavier del Bac. The leaves of the sotol plant (Dasylirium wheeleri), also popularly referred to as spoon cactus, were first stripped of their sharp spines, and subsequently split lengthwise and dried. Before use they are moistened and left overnight in damp earth, to make them flexible and easy to weave with, in this case into a plaited herringbone pattern. The plaiting of baskets and mats was often done by elderly women who were too old to gather wild foods or do corn grinding. The square-bottomed baskets were used to store food, household utensils, tools, and a variety of personal possessions, and to strain saguaro wine. Rim treatment is usually simple, but in some cases \"fancy\" such as in the Leiden herringbone twill specimen, exhibiting an extra decorative woven pattern (Russell 1908:145-148; Kissell 1916:150-165; Underhill 1939:103; Tanner 1983:148-151; Whiteford 1988:120,132).\r\n\r\n362-28 through 32, 40 through 44, 79, 80, 81 Piman basketry\r\n\tAll authors who studied Piman basketry have stressed that it is often difficult to distinguish between Pima and Papago baskets (Kissell 1916; Tanner 1983:120-174; Whiteford 1988:117-142). Although tribal identifications of early baskets have been and still are based on raw materials used, basket shapes, and decorative treatment, these and other authors also point to the trade in raw materials for basketry between Pimas and Papagos, the exchange of baskets in trade, and intermarriage in the nineteenth century (e.g. Underhill 1939:103). The degree of intervention of these factors on tribal typology of basketry styles is difficult to determine, but tribal typology of basketry thus becomes a somewhat tenuous endeavor. For this chapter of the Ten Kate catalogue a cautious approach is employed. In every case it is indicated among which group Ten Kate collected the individual baskets. On the basis of diagnostic traits a tribal identification has been suggested, following the lead of American experts in the field.\r\n \r\n\tThe Pimas were the most productive weavers of containers, as the raw materials required for their manufacture were relatively abundant in their territory which was dissected by watercourses as the Gila, San Pedro, Santa Cruz and Aravaipa. In the more arid Papaguería these were much harder to find. Thus, the Pimas traded raw materials with their southern neighbors, as well as many of their own baskets. In their coils they used bundles of cattail (Thypha agustifolia) with cottonwood (Populus fremontii) sometimes as a substitute, resulting in a thinner, more pliable but less durable container. Papago baskets are thicker, stiffer and sturdier because the use of bundles of beargrass (Nolina microcarpa) for the foundation, and sometimes Spanish bayonet (Yucca baccata) as a substitute. For the binding, Pimas used light-colored willow (Salix nigra or Salix gooddingii) and cottonwood extensively, while dark-colored devil's claw (Martynia fragrans) was used only sparingly, and that almost exclusively limited to designs. In contrast, the Papagos overwhelmingly wove with devil's claw, only sometimes with sotol (Dasylirium wheeleri) and used willow for the design. Only when they wove with willow, the designs were applied in a heavy pattern of devil's claw. Thus, in Papago baskets dark tends to dominate light, while in Pima basketry light tends to dominate dark. Tray and bowl shapes tend to differ slightly between the tribes, although the differences are more marked among the latter. The Papagos weave bowls of more globular form, while the Pima bowls tend to be bell-shaped. Papago trays tend to be a bit deeper and have a flatter base. Both groups flattened the coiled surfaces of their baskets by pounding them between stones when they were still moist. This created a flatter surface than usual in coiled basketry.\r\n \r\nDiagonal twilled plaiting is the second technique of basketry weaving the Papagos and Pimas used frequently. Manufactures in this technique included mats for a variety of utilitarian purposes in the household and to protect a woman's back while carrying heavy loads, headbands for tumplines and headrings for carrying pots, cylindrical storage baskets with a square base, and rectangular medicine baskets. Papagos and Mexican Pimas used the thorny leaves of sotol for plaiting. These were first stripped of their sharp spines, and subsequently split lengthwise and dried. Before use they are moistened and left overnight in damp earth, to make them flexible and easy to weave with. Pimas used river cane (Phragmites communis) for plaiting baskets. Plaited baskets were almost always left undecorated. The square-bottomed baskets were used to store food, household utensils, tools, and a variety of personal possessions. Papagos strained their saguaro wine through such baskets. The Northern Papagos were most adept at making coiled basketry while the Southern Papagos excelled at plaiting baskets and matting (Mason 1904:519-525, plates 50,58-61,63,233-235; Russell 1908:145-148; Kissell 1916:150-165; Beals 1934:21-24; Spier 1936:17; Shreve 1943; Douglas 19??; Di Peso 1956:408-415; Cain 1962:28-30; Whiteford 1988:120,132; Bernstein et.al. 2003:35,70-71).\r\n\r\n\tThe O'odam used baskets for a great variety of utilitarian purposes, notably the gathering, preparation, serving, and storage of food, and the keep of personal belongings. Beyond that daily sphere baskets were made by girls during their menstrual seclusion period, and were used in gift exchanges within extended families (Underhill 1939), were used as drums, and held ceremonial items of healers.\r\n(Hovens 2009) \r\n\r\n\r\nKlein mandje van groenachtig stro, met meander versieringen." .
