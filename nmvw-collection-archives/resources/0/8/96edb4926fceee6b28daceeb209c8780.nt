<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/555a9598fd1af28228985a6a70e4c50b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is the only apron in the collection which is made completely from glass beads. Other European trade goods are used as well like canvas and woven ribbons. \r\n\r\nThe belt is made from heavy canvas, which was definitely brought by European traders from the nineteenth century onwards. It has four small pieces of woven ribbon swen to it, which also does not originate on the Islands. The apron itself is one meshwork of beads. It can be assumed that the warp-plaiting technique was used to make the apron, as it was common in the manufacture of arm- and leg bands. Plant fibres would be laid out vertically and parallel to each other on a wooden board. Then another long fibre was taken, which was plaited into the other fibres horizontally. Both threads were pulled through the beads and so a tight bead cloth was produced. \r\nThis one has several width of different rhomboid patterns. Light and dark blue, white, yellow, red and black glass beads are used. The bottom is adorned with a fringe of bead strings which have Pallaquium nut shells, feathers and red cotton strips attached. \r\n\r\nAprons which were made exclusively from glass beads replaced the traditional ones made from shell money and were worn by women at dances and festivals only since the 1930s. The apron was worn specifically at dancing ceremonies or at wedding ceremonials when it served as wedding attire. They were not used for everyday-purposes." .
