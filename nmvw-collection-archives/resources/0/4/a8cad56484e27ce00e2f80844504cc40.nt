<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/0ffebde465df8df21e33e610c2485a70> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Since the start of the Islamic era calligraphy has been a highly regarded art form owing to its close connection to the writing of the Quran. Over the centuries the art form has been applied on multiple media, and developed both as a decorative and an autonomous art form.Hasan Çelebi (1937), a Turkish master of Arabic calligraphy working within the Ottoman stylistic tradition, is known both for his autonomous art-works as well as his designs of calligraphic panels that decorate the interior of mosques.\r\n\r\nCalligraphy in the shape of a tulip reflects the long-standing Ottoman tradition of sculpting people, animals and objects through calligraphy (so called calligrams). The religious phrase “Alhamdulillahi rabbi l-alamina”, which means “Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds”, written in the shape of a tulip is a common phrase. The frame of the calligram consists of zerendud (crushed gold leaf), which is decorated with ebru-art (Ottoman/Turkish tradition of paper marbling) on the inside." .
