From the Cape York region of north-eastern Australia. The sheath was used to keep the ends dry.\r\nThe operator positioned the rounded end of the drill in one of the hearth pits (small rounded pits) and rotated the drill at speed, in standing position. Elsewhere in Aboriginal Australia firemakers operated in a seated position." .
