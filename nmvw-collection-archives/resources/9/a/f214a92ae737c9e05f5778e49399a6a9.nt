<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2a6604359c3918dbbf6b55304106a9d8> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This drill is made coconut, wood, iron and cord.\r\nHalf a coconut shell is tied to a hollow wooden stick. Above the coconut, there is a another stick attached horizontally. Underneath the coconut, there is an iron point tied to the stick with rattan fibre. It is not known what the iron, which is not originally found on the islands, has replaced. \r\nA third wooden stick is tied to the upper end of the main stick with a long cord. Through twining the cord around the stick, the drill is set into motion and the iron point drills a whole into an object. \r\nThis drill was most likely used to drill holes into wooden objects like canoes and bowls. But it could also be used for dog's teeth, which were then used for necklaces and belts." .
