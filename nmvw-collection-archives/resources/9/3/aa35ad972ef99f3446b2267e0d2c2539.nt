<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/d0e1616c792f39fb5386e6ee16b00cac> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "'This is the big river at Thundi. This is my Father's country on Bentinck Island'. Sally Gabori\r\n\r\nMirdidigkingathi Juwarnda Sally Gabori was born about 1924 on the south side of Bentinck Island of the South Wellesley Island Group in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland. Her Kayardild language name Mirdidigkingathi means 'born at Mirdidingki', her country on Bentinck Island, and Juwarnda means 'dolphin', her totem. Sally Gabori began painting in 2005 at the Mornington Island Arts & Crafts centre. Her immediate love of paint and the full spectrum of colour triggered an outpouring of ideas including the depiction her country and ancestral stories. Whilst her works are immediately recognisable as abstraction, her fascination with colour seems as significant as the content itself.\r\n\r\nBENTINCK ISLAND\r\nBentinck Island was initially discovered by Jan Carstenz in 1623 and was also one of the first parts of the Gulf of Carpentaria surveyed in detail by the explorer Matthew Flinders in 1802. After Flinders' brief encounter the Kaiadilt remained isolated for the next 145 years. There had also been intermittent documented contact with Bentinck Islanders from 1901, and 1925 Presbyterian Missionaries made systematic efforts to relocate them to Mornington Island.\r\n\r\nIn the 1940s severe drought affected communities in the Gulf. This culminated in the deterioratio9n of Kaiadilt homelands and the eventual transportation of the population to Mornington Island by the missionaries. In the 1980's the Kaladilt people began to re-establish themselves on Bentinck Island. However, the Mornington Island Island community of Gununa is still major resource centre for these people today." .
