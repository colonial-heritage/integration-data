<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/de7bc1a934656191a9aec1ecc6929c7b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This bracelet is a ring made from the Trochus shell and incised with patterns that are coloured black. The whole upper coil is knocked off, so that only the lowest ring is left. It is not known, who manufactured the rings.\r\nSeveral of them are worn together on the upper arm by men and women, often in combination with other arm decoration. \r\nThey are considered among the more prestigious adornments, because shells are not as abundant and not easy to be worked on. Often the villages have their typical pattern which is repeated on all the village arm rings." .
