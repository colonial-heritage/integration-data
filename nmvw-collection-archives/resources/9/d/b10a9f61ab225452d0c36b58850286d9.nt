<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/f8dd95f46a31d466231aee1a3e6f90e3> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This bag is plaited of bast fibre. The fibre can be taken from different trees. Some fibres are dyed dark to create a contrasting pattern. The bag has a rectangular shape.\r\nThe bag is manufactured by women. First, the bottom is plaited into the desired width. Then the two sides are plaited upwards in one piece. The fibres at the sides are plaited into several cords or left loose. When the bag is used, the cords or loose fibres are knotted together to form a carrying strap. In the centre of the opening, some fibres are left to close the bag. The bottom has a fringe of fibres. \r\nThe pattern is created through the different colours of the fibres and the alteration of the binding structure. The patterns consist of geometrical patterns like rhomboids, triangles and rectangles.\r\nThe bag is used mostly by women, but also men, though in a different way and for a different purpose.\r\nWomen carry those bags on their back, with the straps knotted and placed on top of the head. Sometimes, several bags are carried at once. They are used for carrying plants, roots and fruit from the gardens and market. Even children can be carried in them.\r\nThe men carry those kind of bags on their shoulder. The middle is tied together with a cord , so that one side of the bag is hanging in the front, the other in the back. This helps to distribute the weight. Men carry smaller items like betel nuts or a gourd in the bags." .
