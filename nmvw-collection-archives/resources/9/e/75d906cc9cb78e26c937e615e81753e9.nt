<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/079dbd2f297fcb0138ade44d7d212bb5> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Maku Inmaku Pakani\r\n\r\nThe Maku Tjukurpa (witchetty grub songline) is a significant songline from Mimilli. It is a story about mai (food), a womens tjukurpa. The minyma (women) would go to the kapi tjukurla (water hole) on top of the rocks at Antara. They would roll rocks from the top of the apu down the mountain. Then, the minyma would clean out the rockhole and wait for the rain to come. \r\nWhen the waterhole was full with water they would tap on the waters surface with a stick and sing inma and paluni inmaku pakani (dance ceremony). They would then dig under the Maku (witchetty bush) and would find Maku tjuta (enough Maku for everyone).\r\n\r\nMimili is sited within the beautiful Everard Rangers on the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in the north-west of South Australia and 448 kilometres south-west of Alice Springs. Mimili is home to 300 Pitjantjatjara Yakunytjatjara peoples who have been living in the area for millennnia in harmony with nature and acting as custodians of the land and the Wapar (creation stories). Mimili was formerly known as Everard Park, which was a cattle station that was returned to Aboriginal ownership through the 1981 AP Lands Acte. Mimili Community was incorporated as an Aboriginal Community in 1975." .
