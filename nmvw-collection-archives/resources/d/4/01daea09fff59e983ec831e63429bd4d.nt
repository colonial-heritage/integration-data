Giving sweet food during different rituals in a wedding is very common. One could exchange sweets during the 'Roka' ritual, which takes place a few days before the actual wedding. Here, both couples' families meet and exchange gifts, including sweets. It is important also to present the sweets in an appealing manner to mark the occasion, which is why a pot like this could be used. The gifting of sweet food during various stages of Punjabi Hindu weddings is still a vital part of marriage rituals, so it would not be uncommon to see sweets transported in a pot like this today." .
