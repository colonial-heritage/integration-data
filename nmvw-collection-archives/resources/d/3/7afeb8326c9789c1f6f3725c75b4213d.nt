<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/2a219bd11f95389276e49b58b3f3afab> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "These ornaments are carved from one piece of wood and were attached to the prow or rear of a canoe. They are shaped in a longish, curved triangle. The frame is solid wood and has carvings all over, some look like little suns. Above that there is openwork decoration with spirals and loops in different compartments. The upper rims are toothed. The object on the bottom has a line of swimming birds on the straight upper side. The upper prow has three stylised human heads on this side. One can easily make out the parts of the ornaments which were attached to the dugout canoe, as they are thinner and not decorated. The prows are coloured red with white and black colour on the carvings.  \r\nThe patterns and paintings on the canoe prow were unique to the clans which manufactured them. This way the canoes were easily identified as to their owners and origin. Clan members identified with the symbols on the canoes and it thus built a strong link between the individual members of the clan.  A large canoe was one of the most valuable possessions a clan had regarding the importance of seafaring for  food supply, transport, trade and cultural exchange.\r\nCanoes are also associated with the ancestors which came from the horizon in the \"first canoe\" to settle the islands." .
