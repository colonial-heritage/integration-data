It might be a fan called panjukson, as it has dark red dots on the edges of ribs. These dark red dots are said to be painted with fermented urine.  Probably bleached cow bones are carved and fixed to the end of the ribs.  The folded paper of the fan is pale yellow and has no patterns on it. Its pivot is probably made of nickel." .
