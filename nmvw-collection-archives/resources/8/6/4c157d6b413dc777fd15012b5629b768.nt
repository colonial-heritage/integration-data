<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/98faf4f019032574dd16b01a6b5d842b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a round stone with a hole bored through it. It was most likely a weight for a digging stick. San peoples often used weighted sticks to dig for roots and bulbs, or to dig pits to trap game. The weighted stick made digging easier in places where the soil was hard. There is a large diversity in the size and weight of such stones and this has led to speculation that these objects may also have had other uses such as in rituals to communicate with the supernatural world.\r\n\r\nThis particular stone is one of the first two South African objects, along with a metal spear tip, to arrive at the Rijks Ethnographische Museum (Museum Volkenkunde) in 1864. It was found by Gosuinus Palier at Rietrivier in Jacobsdal in the Orange Free State in what is now South Africa. It was donated to the museum by Edouard van Olden, a Dutch emigrant to the Free State, who sent it to Herman Schlegel at the Rijks Natuurhistorisch Museum (Naturalis). Schlegel in turn referred Van Olden to the ethnographic museum where it is still part of the collection." .
