It was intended to be placed under globe-shaped pots to prevent their fall. It is manufactured by men. \r\nAs the ordinary pots are all of the same size, the rings which come from Tobati are of the same width as those met with on Lake Sentani. The height is such that the pot is supported all around and the bottom remains free from the floor. Those which come from private houses, appear to be the property of the women, at least at Asei the persons, who wanted to deal with Sande in these articles, mowda, were women. \r\nThese support are only plaited in Asei. Each village of Lake Sentani is specialize in on specific production. The exchanges between them compensate for the unequal wealths sharing out. In Tobati it is called muda (mura) or medjua." .
