<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/268e88877fd0883435dd33cff8e6f1ac> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This wooden figure serves as a leg for a wooden bed or cot. It is carved from one piece of wood, which was done by men. This leg consists of three parts, the cylindrical foot on which the whole figure rests, a human figure and on its head a thick pin which is put into a whole of the bed frame. Either all four legs show the same motif or there are two pairs and the two legs on the short side show the same motif. The frame of the beds were also richly adorned with carvings and often showed an animal's head or the typical spiral motif found on wooden bowls and ladles. They were hardly long enough to hold the whole body, so people had to sleep with their knees up. \r\nThis leg represents a female figure, which has big ears, the traditional hairdo and carvings all over the body. The arms lie sidewise close to the body. \r\nThe beds were used as resting place, but also had a ceremonial function. It was used for weddings where the adorned bride was carried to her husband's house on such a bed. The bed was then part of the dowry. It is not sure whether sleeping beds and ceremonial beds had different designs or special motifs. \r\nDuring the day, beds would also serve as chairs and tables." .
