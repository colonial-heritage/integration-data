<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/076c634f367a04a1f92c2dc0e361003a> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This bark-cloth was worn as an apron by only the women. \r\nTo produce it, the bark of the breadfruit tree, which was still on the tree itself, was hit with a special beater. This beater  was a wooden stick to which a shell was tied with rattan strips. The bark was beaten with the convex outer side of the shell so that the outer layer fell off in little pieces. The white layer underneath could then be separated from the squashy core of the tree trunk. The bark-cloth was washed and could then be used as an apron.\r\nSeveral pieces of bark-cloth were sewn together to make this apron. Either two or four cloths are tied around the hip and fixed with a broad plaited belt. A small part is folded over the belt and fixed with another, smaller belt. Two cloths go on the front and the back and if four cloths are worn, they are worn on the sides, so that it looks like a skirt. This sort of unadorned cloth was the everyday clothing of solely the women from the main island Manus. People from the Admiralty Islands are dressed all the time wearing aprons, only the children would walk around completely naked. Women from the other islands wore fibrous aprons." .
