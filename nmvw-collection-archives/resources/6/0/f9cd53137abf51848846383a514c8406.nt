<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/9376a0c69434b94f4ee9eb184c65380a> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This sign was collected by Karel Roskam in Cape Town, though it is not known exactly where it was used. On one side, it reads ‘Whites Only/Net Blankes’ in English and Afrikaans which were the official languages of South Africa through much of the 20th century. The back side is nearly illegible, but likely read ‘Net nie-Blankes/non-Whites Only’.\r\n\r\nSigns like this one were found all over South Africa during the 20th century. During this period South Africa practiced racial segregation, which eventually developed into an extreme form of institutionalized racial segregation known as apartheid (‘separateness’). \r\n\r\nUnder the apartheid system, people were classified by the state according to their race. Those classified as ‘White/European’ controlled almost all of the country’s political and economic power. Those classified as ‘non-White’ were deprived of basic human rights. The apartheid system dictated all aspects of a person’s life including where a person could live, work, which facilities they could use, if they could vote, and who they could marry. \r\n\r\nThis sign was likely used at a railway station and designated which facilities could be used exclusively by South Africans designated as ‘White/European’ and those facilities which could be used by people designated as ‘non-White’. The facilities designated for 'non-Whites' were generally vastly inferior to those provided for 'Whites only'.\r\n\r\nApartheid legislation were repealed in the early 1990s, and South Africa became a multi-racial democracy in 1994." .
