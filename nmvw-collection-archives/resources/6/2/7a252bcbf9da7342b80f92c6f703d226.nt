<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/cce81535b5dcc40dab63734a14023db3> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The artist.\r\n\r\nTjipungaleialumi was the last surviving son of Mangkarra, who in the mid-twentieth century was considered to have been the greatest hunter and fighting leader of the Tikalawila in living memory. The oldest Tiwi at the time of his death in 1968, the artist had spent virtually his entire life in his homeland on Bathurst Island. Powerfully built, mentally alert and very active physically until his last days, he took a keen interest in every manner of social event, especially traditional ritual. At the Pukumani mortuary ceremonies he chanted and danced with vigour and virtuosity, leading and organising his juniors with a ready wit and authoritative manner.\r\n\r\nTjipungaleialumi was a man's man, universally admired and respected among his people, yet the antithesis of a demagogue. When staying near the mission at Nguiu (south east Bathurst Island) he chose always to live and dwell a little apart from the main community, simply uninterested in political power. He was never an adherent of the mission ways and beliefs, and developed only such proficiency in English as suited his lifestyle. All his life he remained comfortably focussed upon his traditional culture, laconically shrugging off mission disapproval of particular cultural practices.\r\n\r\nOther elderly Tiwi admiringly re-told to me many stories of Tjipungaleialumi's brave exploits in his early and middle years. From 1905, the artist had contact with Joel Cooper, the white buffalo-hunter who came to Melville Island to shoot the wild herds of water buffalo. These beasts were descended from those turned loose by the British in 1829 after their brief and disastrous attempt to establish a military settlement on western Melville Island. Cooper's shooters were Aborigines of the mainland Iwadja tribe, and these men took to raiding the camps of Bathurst Island groups for women. The artist had many adventures, some tragic, in the ensuing conflicts with the intruders. Bravery stamped many incidents throughout his exceptionally long life.\r\n\r\nThe carving.\r\n\r\nThe design of the figure is a modification of a Tiwi mortuary post, in miniature. The arms are here shown separated from the figure's trunk. Treatment of the legs echoes the 'window' space in a full-sized mortuary post. The outward taper of the hips downward to the legs is typical of the artist's work. The design elements with which the carving has been painted are all traditional to the Tiwi. These designs were attributed by the \"old people\" (past generations) to Irrakappi (Crocodile), the Creation-time leader of the peoples of Bathurst Island.\r\n\r\nThe artist made the piece in the Dry season of 1965 for Lance Bennett when he was visiting Bathurst Island to spend time with Tjipungaleialumi.\r\n\r\n\r\ncopyright Lance Bennett" .
