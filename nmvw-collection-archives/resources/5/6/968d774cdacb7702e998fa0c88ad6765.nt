Tsinhnahjinnie (b.1954). At the centre of the work is the photograph of a small girl looking at the camera and dressed in a checked dress, she is on a chair.  At the rear is a photograph of the moon landing and Neil Armstrong on the moon, so the little girl looks like she is speeding around on the moon, she is peaking out at the world from space. This is a comment about colonising spaces.\r\n\r\n`Hoke’Tee' (original created in 2003) is part of series of work called `Portraits Against Amnesia'. This series uses photographic portraits that Tsinhnahjinnie has ‘rescued’ through e-bay, bidding against other dealers/collectors, and often she remarked being successful when the photographs did not feature people dressed in traditional regalia which adds to commercial appeal. Her aim is to find images that have a different quality – for example here, a family portrait and then to resituate them in a different position and by implications amongst a series of different possibilities, and thus in a different relationship with the viewers. Tsinhnahjinnie has noted ‘When creating conceptual indigenous art, a space is realised. A space that is occupied and owned by the aboriginal collective unconscious’.\r\n\r\nThe amnesia describes both the process by which photographs of individuals/persons have over time lost their identity, and therefore become the stuff of e-bay trade, and the way in which indigenous North American people have been asked to typify a people, with all the mythologies that this encourages." .
