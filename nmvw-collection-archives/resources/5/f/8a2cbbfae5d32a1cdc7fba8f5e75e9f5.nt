<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/8c4cba31b0e71383ab5cb4f59f08a7ef> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This is a poster depicting the late Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, as a mother-goddess of the Indian nation. She presided over a particularly tumultuous period of Indian history, and she was assassinated in 1984. This poster most likely was made post 1984, as a way of paying homage to her. Those who supported Indira Gandhi saw her as a protector of the nation. Therefore you see two children piously praying to her." .
