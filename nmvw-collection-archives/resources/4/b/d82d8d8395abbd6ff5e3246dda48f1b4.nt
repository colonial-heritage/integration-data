Its diameter is oval and it has a wooden frame construction, to which palm leaves are attached for roofing and outside cover. The rectangular door opening in the front has two thresholds (2802-96-2 and 3).\r\nIn front of the house there are standing two wooden beds. \r\n\r\nThe framing construction in the life-sized houses would consist of two rows of three posts, which were holding beams parallel to the long sides of the house. The rows are as far apart as the house is wide and the posts as high as an adult man. On the beams, there were three other beams, but this time they were in a right angle to the long sides of the house. On these there was one post each, which all together would hold the big ridge pole which carries the weight of the roof." .
