<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/6e4979ab668db7ae632fabb696faaf25> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This vessel is made of a hollowed coconut which is coated with Parinarium putty. The coconut is freed from all outer hair and then smoothed. A bamboo cane is glued to the small opening on the top  and serves as a bottleneck. Sometimes not the whole coconut is covered with putty, but there is an elevated Parinarium ring around the centre of the nut or other elevated decorations. This ring the elevations have engravings, which are painted white and red.\r\nThe manufacture was the work of men. \r\nThe vessel serves as water container and as a bottle to pour water." .
