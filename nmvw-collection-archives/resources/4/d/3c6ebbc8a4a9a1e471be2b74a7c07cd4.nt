The inner whorl was taken out. The outside of the shell is polished. \r\nThe tip of the penis is put into the mouth of the shell. \r\nIt is not a cover for the penis, but rather a male adornment, which is worn at dances which are held when a new men's hut is built, a funeral is held or a trading relation is celebrated. It  is especially associated with war dances and war adornment." .
