Full-size pukumani poles could stand as high as two metres, and would be erected around the grave. Their designs and forms would relate both to the traditional totemic designs of the deceased, and to particular secular episodes or scenes, which would be reenacted in ceremony. Examples of full-sized poles are held in museum." .
