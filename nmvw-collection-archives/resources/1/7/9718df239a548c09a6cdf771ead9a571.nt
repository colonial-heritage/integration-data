Ten very long, very thin and pointy wooden skewers are stuck into a quite short wooden shaft, probably made from a hollowed reed like bamboo. The skewers are fixed with rattan strips on two spots. They diverge at the top because the lower tips are pressed tightly into the shaft. \r\n\r\nThese spears were used for fishing in coastal water." .
