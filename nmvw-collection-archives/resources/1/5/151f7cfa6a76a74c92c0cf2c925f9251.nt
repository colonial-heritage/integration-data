Bags were also used as food strainers and sifters. As sifters, vegetable foods containing dangerous toxins were crushed or sliced, placed inside bags or baskets and washed until the harmful substances were removed. In food-gathering, bags were used to collect such items as nuts, fruits, yams and eggs." .
