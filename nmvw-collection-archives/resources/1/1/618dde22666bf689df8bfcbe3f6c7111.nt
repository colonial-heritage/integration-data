It is carved from wood and largely decorated with coix seeds and abrus pips. The eyes of the fish are indicated by abrus pips. There are a few real feathers attached to the body, mainly on the sides and fins. On the bottom there is a hole to which a bamboo stick was attached by means of which the ornament was carried above the bearer's head. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the donor, children carried this object attached to a stick during the parade in honour of the marriage of Princess Juliana of the Netherlands. \t\t\t\t\t\t           \t\t\t\t \r\nThis fish figure is an emblem of the Bragai-ze-ha clan of the Bragai-ze phratry representing a totemic ancestor/animal, whose ritual significance and cultural symbolism are rooted in Marind mythology.\r\n\r\nIVANA HLADKA, 28.11. 2006" .
