Kolams are highly auspicious geometrical patterns that are drawn in front of houses or thresholds that mark off sacred space. A kolam therefore marks of the entrance of a house as an auspicious space and protects it. Kolams are 'drawn' most often by wives of households. Each morning, a kolam is drawn out in the powder, and by the end of the day, parts of it may have been blown away, or carried away by insects. The next morning, a new kolam will be drawn. The drawing of kolams is important domestic religious work that, among gendered female Hindus  (particularly across the higher caste communities) is essential to the harmonious running of a household. This object is an interesting example of a practice of gendered female identity among Hindus. Kolams are also drawn in diasporic contexts." .
