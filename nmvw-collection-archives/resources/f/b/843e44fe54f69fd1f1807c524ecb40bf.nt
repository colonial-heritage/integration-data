<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/87d36966b3ed961500b3fde7d7bc468b> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "This spear is made completely from wood. A long, pointy and forked wooden spear head is tied to a wooden shaft which is tied to a handle, probably made from a hollowed reed like bamboo. The lower part of the wooden joint is wound with fibre cords and then coated with Parinarium to glue it to the handle. The middle part of the woode piece is rhomboid with a hole in the middle and is incised with patterns and coloured white. Diagonally wound fibre cord on top of the coating make a rhomboid pattern which is painted black and white and has Coix seeds stuck into it. The spear head is secured with tightly wound fibre cords which are painted with black, red and white rhomboids. It is made from one piece of wood and only separates into two forks in its second third. The forks are toothed. \r\nIt is not really sure whether these kinds of spears were used in battle or rather as a ceremonial dance object held by men while dancing. Another possibility is the manufacture of these spears for sale to the Europeans. Unfortunately, there is not enough information about it in the literature." .
