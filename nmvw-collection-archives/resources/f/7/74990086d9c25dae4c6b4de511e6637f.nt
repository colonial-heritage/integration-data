<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/fc502a71dd239e4209a33e5fda7c6294> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "In its general form and outline this shield probably originates in the coastal NSW region, even from the vicinity of Sydney, which would make it extremely rare. The shield is unochred. It has a withy handle; a piece of green wood has been inserted into two holes in the centre of the shield and allowed to cure in a bent position, forming the handle.\r\n\r\nShields serve several functions.  Primarily, they are used as defensive weapons in combat.  They also function as cermonial objects and are often used in dance.  Increasingly, shields have been produced for commerical reasons.  Their aesthetic qualities have rendered them a popular collector's item and thus, they are regularly traded." .
