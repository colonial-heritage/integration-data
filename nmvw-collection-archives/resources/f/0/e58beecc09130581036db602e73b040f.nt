However, the material culture of weapon manufacture was at least as important as actual technical and physical skills. Feuds and war were fought for the usual reasons; disputes over women or pigs, personal insults, accusations of sorcery, territorial disputes, disputes over access to food resources, and revenge. Warfare included stealthy raids, attacks from ambush, and ritualized battles. \r\nArchery dominated warfare in the New Guinea. Arrow shafts were mostly bamboo. Generally, arrows were about 150 cm long, although arrows as long as 230 cm have also been reported. Bamboo, wood, bone tips were attached to the bamboo shafts using string made from plant fiber. Tips were sometimes heated, thereby creating a brittle arrowhead, which would fragment on contact and create an infected wound. Hunting arrows were utilitarian, but ceremonial and dueling arrows were sometimes elaborately decorated.\r\nThe arrows produced by the Papuan tribes of New Guinea rival those of many of the world’s nontribal societies in terms of diversity and complexity of arrowheads. Numerous specialized heads were made, including multipronged heads for bird hunting and fishing, bamboo blades for hunting, and plain and barbed hardwood tips for warfare. The shafts are of reed, nockless, and rarely decorated; embellishment is saved for the foreshafts and heads, which often are elaborately carved and adorned with pigments and orchid-fiber wrapping. These arrows were sometimes used for ceremonial and exchange purposes, but they were also commonly used in combat." .
