<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/b7826d784037b0e336ef75fb5aee17b9> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Artist's statement:\r\nAlliance collars were created on the eastern seaboard, but valued all over the northeast into the Great Lakes and Canada. Often translated ‘Friendship Collars’ by early Jesuit missionaries and explorers, they have long been worn by important tribal individuals, and to honor strong political relationships between Native Nations and later, with European trading partners and nations. The now-rare semi-circular form of the dual purple and white wampum was woven with hundreds of pucquahog shell beads in a generous drape with smoked deerskin ties. Historically,  many Wampanoag wampum belts were woven with elk gut sinew or butterfly weed cordage; this contemporary version features very fine wampum beads on quality waxed beading thread in a diagonal line and star pattern, with the glass bead edging reflecting the long association between Dutch and Native peoples; the continuation of traditional forms with introduced materials. The white glass beads are glossy, rounded and monochromatic versus the slight variability of natural material used for tube wampum beads. \r\nTribal lands at Aquinnah on Marthas Vineyard MA, as well as at Burr’s Hill RI  and Block Island CT are sites where archeologists have recovered  glass trade beads from Dutch and other European traders that came in the 16th and 17th century. But shared space and ideas in Native homelands and colonial space is evidenced by many things, and can include cuisine, politics, hairstyles, religious practice, sports and even words. Within my Aquinnah family lineage there is Block Island/ Menassis. Connection with the Dutch influence was kept alive by using the name Alzata for generations women according to my Aquinnah aunts. Marthas Vineyard was part of the New York Colony for a time. In making this collar I am reflecting on historical ties and travel certainly, but also new collaborative projects as a modern Native artist." .
