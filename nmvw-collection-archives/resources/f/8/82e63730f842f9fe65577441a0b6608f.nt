<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/380064d8fcef180e2584b075cf7b7533> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "The comb is made of coconut leaf ribs which are tied together with plant fibre. At the upper end the skewers are glued together with a mass of Parinarium nut. The Parinarium is coloured with red from the 'mbuhul' plant and formed to shape a crocodile's head. It is decorated with carvings that show the eyes and the mouth, where it has European glass beads. The carvings are coloured white with lime.\r\nThe crocodile is one of the most important ancestral beings which created the earth and everything that is on it today. It is naturally closely associated with the water, which is considered the most important of the primal elements and in which the dead souls and ancestral beings dwell. The crocodile therefore represents an earthly link to the second world of the spirits, with which people constantly try to interact.\r\nThe comb was worn mostly by men at rituals and feasts as a decoration in the hair, sometimes used as part of the bride price for women." .
