<https://n2t.net/ark:/27023/f7d362695d90033b527e530f124cbc9d> <https://colonialcollections.nl/schema#description> "Boomerangs serve numerous functions.  Boomerangs are used as a knife, a hammer or club, a digging tool, for making fire by friction, for musical accompaniment as a percussion instrument as well as their main function as a hunting or fighting weapon. It is important to note that most fighting and hunting boomerangs were non-returning.  They were thrown to hit their targets and not return. Boomerangs are also used in games and competitions.  Furthermore, they have ceremonial uses, serving as objects of social and religious significance.  They are also produced for commercial reasons and are popular trade items.\r\n\r\nIn pre-European times, traditional painted designs or carvings found on boomerangs served more than an aesthetic function. Usually, decorations refer to Dreaming Ancestors and to local territory associated with these Dreamings." .
