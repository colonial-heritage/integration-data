As with this bowl, the decoration was often an elegant black design against a white background. From looking at other bowls from the same period, it is clear that the black brushstroke at the center of the bowl is an abstracted bird.\r\n\r\nThe simple designs of these slipware ceramics were often coveted by European collectors for their affinity to modernist aesthetics.\r\n\r\nSee Oliver Watson, Ceramics from Islamic Lands (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2004), 205 -- 217." .
